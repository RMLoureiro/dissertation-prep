@article{blockchain_consensus,
  abstract   = {Blockchain is the core technology of many cryptocurrencies. Blockchain as a distributed ledger technology has received extensive research attention. In addition to cryptography and P2P (peer-to-peer) technology, consensus protocols are also a fundamental part of the blockchain technology. A good consensus protocol can guarantee the fault tolerance and security of the blockchain systems. The consensus protocols currently used in most blockchain systems can be broadly divided into two categories: the probabilistic-finality consensus protocols and the absolute-finality consensus protocols. This paper introduces some of the main consensus protocols of these two categories, and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses as well as the applicable blockchain types.},

@article{paxos,
  abstract   = {At the PODC 2001 conference, I got tired of everyone saying how difficult it was to understand the Paxos algorithm, published in [122]. Although people got so hung up in the pseudo-Greek names that they found the paper hard to understand, the algorithm itself is very simple. So, I cornered a couple of people at the conference and explained the algorithm to them orally, with no paper. When I got home, I wrote down the explanation as a short note, which I later revised based on comments from Fred Schneider and Butler Lampson. The current version is 13 pages long, and contains no formula more complicated than n1 > n2.},

abstract = {Solana is a blockchain protocol that has gained significant attention in the cryptocurrency community. This work examines Solana’s consensus protocol and its reference implementation. In this paper we try to get an understanding of the Solana protocol. However, this is not so easy because the publicly available resources are insufficient to specify the details of the protocol. Moreover, the implementation has deviated in undocumented ways from the available protocol design description. Thus the consensus rules and their implied security properties remain unclear. We evaluate a number of experimental scenarios in a local Solana testnet. These tests seem to confirm our basic understanding that Solana does not fully achieve consensus. In this paper we show how a single malicious validator, once elected as leader, might be able to halt the Solana blockchain. We also observe some inconsistent behavior, which is not readily explained by any of the consensus rules we are aware of.},
